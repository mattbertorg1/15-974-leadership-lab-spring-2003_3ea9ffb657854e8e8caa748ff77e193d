The student project teams focus on ideas and initiatives that put social responsibility in business into practice--either in the context of Sloan or MIT or in the context of another organization, company, or community. Last term, for example, one student group established Waste Awareness Day at MIT. Another group focused on the strategic redesign of a new MIT building as a highly visible ecological model project. Another one helped Ben & Jerry’s to identify Boston-area non-profit organizations for partnering in their local community-building efforts and programs (partner shops). Here are three other examples:
